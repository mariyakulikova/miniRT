## **📝 Scene File Format (`.rt`)**

The scene file describes all elements of the scene with specific identifiers and attributes. Here’s an example:

```plaintext
A 0.2 255,255,255
C -50,0,20 0,0,1 70
L -40,0,30 0.7 255,255,255
pl 0,0,0 0,1.0,0 255,0,225
sp 0,0,20 20 255,0,0
cy 50.0,0.0,20.6 0,0,1.0 14.2 21.42 10,0,255
```
